[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there
has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the
public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

An `R` package for reliability coefficients and factor scores for the
linear factor model.

## Installation

From inside `R`, use the following command:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/reliable")
```

## Usage

Use `lavaan` to fit a linear factor model.

``` r
library("reliable")

model = ' visual  =~ x1 + x2 + x3
          textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6
          speed   =~ x7 + x8 + x9 '

object = lavaan::cfa(model = model,
                     data = lavaan::HolzingerSwineford1939)
```

Now you we can find the sum-score reliability and the associated factor
scores.

``` r
reliability(object, type = "sumscore")
#> $reliability
#> [1] 0.7569798
#> 
#> $weights
#>           [,1]
#> [1,] 0.8691074
#> 
#> $iota
#>       [,1] [,2] [,3]
#>  [1,]    1    0    0
#>  [2,]    0    0    0
#>  [3,]    1    0    0
#>  [4,]    0    1    0
#>  [5,]    0    1    0
#>  [6,]    0    1    0
#>  [7,]    0    0    1
#>  [8,]    0    0    1
#>  [9,]    0    0    1
#> 
#> $inflation
#> [1] 4.114885
```

And we can find the linear reliability and the associated factor scores.

``` r
reliability(object, type = "linear")
#> $reliability
#> [1] 0.7962199
#> 
#> $weights
#>          [,1]        [,2]        [,3]
